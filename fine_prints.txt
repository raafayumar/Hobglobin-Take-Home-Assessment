this Agreement. 

17. Insurance

State for the same. 

E. Available Coverages/Limits

Any person that submits a bid or proposal to, or otherwise proposes to enter into or renew an 
Agreement with, a State agency with respect to any Agreement in the amount of one hundred

completed, signed, and returned with its bid or proposal.  

19. Darfur Contracting Act 

A. The Darfur Contracting Act, Public Contract Code Section 10475-10481, applies to any 

company that currently or within the previous three (3) years has had business activities or other 
operations outside of the United States. The Act was passed by the California Legislature and 
signed into law by the Governor to preclude State agencies generally from contracting with 
“scrutinized” companies that do business in the African nation of Sudan (of which the Darfur 
region is a part), for the reasons described in Public Contract Code Section 10475. All bidders 
shall complete the Darfur Contracting Act Certification (DOT ADM-0077), provided as a link 
in Attachment 3, Required Documents, and submit with the proposal.   

B. If your company has not, within the previous three (3) years, had any business activities or other 

operations outside

--- Fine Print #6 ---
, and returned with its bid or proposal.  

19. Darfur Contracting Act 

A. The Darfur Contracting Act, Public Contract Code Section 10475-10481, applies to any 

company that currently or within the previous three (3) years has had business activities or other 
operations outside of the United States. The Act was passed by the California Legislature and 
signed into law by the Governor to preclude State agencies generally from contracting with 
“scrutinized” companies that do business in the African nation of Sudan (of which the Darfur 
region is a part), for the reasons described in Public Contract Code Section 10475. All bidders 
shall complete the Darfur Contracting Act Certification (DOT ADM-0077), provided as a link 
in Attachment 3, Required Documents, and submit with the proposal.   

B. If your company has not, within the previous three (3) years, had any business activities or other 

operations outside of the United States, complete Option 1 on the ADM-0077. 

C. A scrutinized company is a company doing business in Sudan as defined in Public Contract 

Code Section 10476. Scrutinized companies are ineligible to, and cannot, bid on or submit a 
proposal for an Agreement with a State agency for goods or services (Pub. Cont. Code Section 
10477(a)). 

D. Therefore, Public Contract Code Section 10478(a) requires a company that currently has (or 

within the previous three (3) years has had) business activities or other operations outside of the 
United States to certify that it is not a “scrutinized” company, during the Agreement award 
process with a State agency. 

E. A scrutinized company may still, however, submit a bid or proposal for a Contract with a State 

agency for goods or services if the company first obtains permission from the Department of 
General Services (DGS) according to the criteria set forth in Public Contract Code Section 
10477(b).

D. Only an individual who is legally authorized to bind the proposing firm contractually shall sign all 

documents requiring a signature, and each document must bear a signature. 

E. Email to: Wendy.Kwong@dot.ca.gov  

F. Pursuant to Government Code Section 14838.7, Caltrans must receive at least two (2) price 

quotes from certified SB/MBs or at least two (2) price quotes from DVBEs before it can make an 
Agreement award. Therefore, at Caltrans’ discretion, if only one price quote is received, the 
timeframe for receipt of price quotes may be extended in order to receive the minimum number 
of quotes required by the Government Code. All prospective bidders will be notified via email or 
telephone of any extensions. 

G. Price quotes must include the performance of all the services described herein. Any attempt to 

modify the Price Quote Proposal document to deviate from the work specifications will not be 
considered and will cause a price quote to be rejected. 

H. A price quote may be rejected if it is conditional, incomplete, or if it contains any alterations of 

form or other irregularities of any kind. Caltrans may reject any price quote on the basis that it is 
not responsive or from responsible bidder and may waive any immaterial deviation in a quote. 
Caltrans’ waiver of an immaterial defect shall in no way modify the IFPQ document or excuse 
the bidder from full compliance with all requirements if awarded the Agreement. 

I. Costs for developing price quotes and in anticipation of award of the Agreement are entirely the 

responsibility of the bidder and shall not be charged to Caltrans.

form or other irregularities of any kind. Caltrans may reject any price quote on the basis that it is

I. Costs for developing price quotes and in anticipation of award of the Agreement are entirely the 

responsibility of the bidder and shall not be charged to Caltrans. 

J. A bidder may modify a price quote after its submission by first withdrawing the original price 

quote and then by resubmitting a new price quote prior to the price quote submittal deadline. 
Bidder modifications offered in any other manner, oral or written, will not be considered. 

K. A bidder may withdraw a price quote by, prior to price quote submission deadline, submitting a 

written withdrawal request to Caltrans, at Wendy.Kwong@dot.ca.gov, signed by the bidder or an 
agent authorized in accordance with Section L, below. A bidder may thereafter submit a new 
price quote prior to the price quote submittal deadline. Price quotes may not be withdrawn 
without cause subsequent to the price quote submittal deadline. 

L. Only an individual who is authorized to bind the bidding firm contractually shall sign the attached 

Bid/Bidder Certification Sheet. The signature must also indicate the title or position that the 
individual holds in the firm. An unsigned price quote may be cause for bid rejection. 

M. Caltrans may modify the IFPQ prior to the date fixed for submission of price quotations by the 

issuance of an addendum sent to all parties who received an IFPQ package. 

N. Caltrans reserves the right to reject all price quotes for reasonable cause. 

O. Bidders are cautioned not to rely on Caltrans during its evaluation process to discover and 

report to the bidder any defects and errors in the submitted documents. Before submitting their 
documents, bidders should carefully proof them for errors and full adherence to the IFPQ 
requirements. 

P. Where applicable, bidder should carefully examine work sites and specifications. Bidder shall 

investigate conditions, character, and quality of surface or subsurface materials or obstacles 
that might be encountered. No additions or increases to the Agreement amount will be made 
due to a lack of careful examination of work sites and specifications. 

Q. Caltrans does not accept alternate Agreement language from a bidder. A price quote with such 

language will be considered a counter proposal and will be rejected. The State’s General

21. Evaluation and Selection 

A. At the time of quote opening, each price quote will be checked for the presence or absence of 

required information in conformance with the submission requirements of this IFPQ. 

B. Caltrans will check the price quote submittal package to verify it received all required 

documents. Positive verification of required documents will be performed to determine its 
responsiveness to the State’s needs. 

C. Price quotes that contain false or misleading statements, or which provide references, which do 

not support an attribute or condition claimed by the bidder, shall be rejected. 

D. The Agreement, if awarded, shall be awarded to the responsible bidder who submits the lowest 

price quote and meets all the specifications. A price quote meets the specifications if it complies 
with all the requirements in this solicitation. In the event of a tie quote, Caltrans will draw lots to 
determine the successful bidder. Only one (1) price quote may be submitted by an entity: 
individual, firm, partnership, corporation, joint venture, or combination thereof. Receipt of more

2 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code) arising from purchases of goods,

23. Executive Order N-6-22 – Russia Sanctions 

On March 4, 2022, Governor Gavin Newsom issued Executive Order N-6-22 (the EO) regarding

refers to sanctions imposed by the U.S. government in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, as 
well as any sanctions imposed under state law unless the contract has been Federalized (i.e., there 
is federal participation in any phase). By submitting a bid or proposal, Contractor represents that it 
is not a target of Economic Sanctions. Should the State determine Contractor is a target of 
Economic Sanctions or is conducting prohibited transactions with sanctioned individuals or entities, 
that shall be grounds for rejection of Contractor’s bid/proposal any time prior to contract execution, 
or, if determined after contract execution, shall be grounds for termination by the State. 

24. Executive Order N-12-23 – Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) Technology Use and 

Reporting 

A. The State of California seeks to realize the potential benefits of GenAI, through the development 

and deployment of GenAI tools, while balancing the risks of these new technologies. 

B. Bidder / Offeror must notify the State in writing if it: (1) intends to provide GenAI as a deliverable 

to the State; or (2), intends to utilize GenAI, including GenAI from third parties, to complete all or 
a portion of any deliverable that materially impacts: (i) functionality of a State system, (ii) risk to 
the State, or (iii) Contract performance. For avoidance of doubt, the term “materially impacts” 
shall have the meaning set forth in State Administrative Manual (SAM) § 4986.2 Definitions for 
GenAI. 

C. Failure to report GenAI to the State may result in disqualification. The State reserves the right to 

seek any and all relief to which it may be entitled to as a result of such non-disclosure. 

D. Upon notification by a Bidder / Offeror of GenAI as required, the State reserves the right to 

incorporate GenAI Special Provisions into the final contract or reject bids/offers that present an 
unacceptable level of risk to the State. 

E. Government Code 11549.64 defines “Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)” as an artificial 

intelligence system that can generate derived synthetic content, including text, images, video, 
and audio that emulates the structure and characteristics of the system’s training data.

17. Darfur Contracting Act 

A. The Darfur Contracting Act, Public Contract Code Section 10475-10481, applies to any 
company that currently or within the previous three (3) years has had business activities or 
other operations outside of the United States. The Act was passed by the California 
Legislature and signed into law by the Governor to preclude State agencies generally from 
contracting with “scrutinized” companies that do business in the African nation of Sudan (of 
which the Darfur region is a part), for the reasons described in Public Contract Code Section 
10475. All bidders shall complete the Darfur Contracting Act Certification (DOT ADM-
0077), provided as a link in Attachment 3, Required Documents, and submit with the 
proposal.   

B. If your company has not, within the previous three (3) years, had any business activities or 
other operations outside of the United States, complete Option 1 on DOT ADM-0077. 

C. A scrutinized company is a company doing business in Sudan as defined in Public Contract 
Code Section 10476. Scrutinized companies are ineligible to, and cannot bid on, or submit a 
bid or proposal for an Agreement with a State agency for goods or services. (Pub. Cont. Code 
Section 10477(a)). 

D. Therefore, Public Contract Code Section 10478(a) requires a company that currently has (or 
within the previous three (3) years has had business activities or other operations outside of 
the United States to certify that it is not a “scrutinized”

--- Fine Print #44 ---
Contracting Act Certification (DOT ADM-
0077), provided as a link in Attachment 3, Required Documents, and submit with the 
proposal.   

B. If your company has not, within the previous three (3) years, had any business activities or 
other operations outside of the United States, complete Option 1 on DOT ADM-0077. 

C. A scrutinized company is a company doing business in Sudan as defined in Public Contract 
Code Section 10476. Scrutinized companies are ineligible to, and cannot bid on, or submit a 
bid or proposal for an Agreement with a State agency for goods or services. (Pub. Cont. Code 
Section 10477(a)). 

D. Therefore, Public Contract Code Section 10478(a) requires a company that currently has (or 
within the previous three (3) years has had business activities or other operations outside of 
the United States to certify that it is not a “scrutinized” company when it submits a bid or 
proposal to a State agency. 

E. A scrutinized company may still, however, submit a bid or proposal for an Agreement with a 
State agency for goods or services if the company first obtains permission from the 
Department of General Services according to the criteria set forth in Public Contract Code 
Section 10477(b). 

18. Iran Contracting Act

renew any Agreement with the State for goods or services of one million dollars or more. 

B. Any person who submits a bid or proposal must complete and submit to Caltrans with its bid 
proposal, the Iran Contracting Act Certification (DOT ADM-0078), provided as a link in 
Attachment 3, Required Documents, certifying that it is not on the most current List unless 
the person is exempted from the certification requirement by Public Contract Code Section 
2203(c) or (d). If claiming an exemption, the person shall provide written evidence that 
supports an exemption under Public Contract Code Section 2203(c) or (d) with its bid or 
proposal.  

C. Any person, for an Agreement that is exempt from bidding or is renewed, or for whom an 
Agreement is otherwise awarded by the State, must complete and submit to Caltrans DOT 
ADM-0078, certifying that it is not on the most current List, before the Agreement has been 
executed by the parties, unless the person is exempted from the certification requirement by 
Public Contract Code Section 2205(c) or (d). If claiming an exemption, the person shall 
provide written evidence that supports an exemption under Public Contract Code Section 
2203(c) or (d), before execution of the Agreement. 

19. Executive Order N-6-22 – Russia Sanctions

refers to sanctions imposed by the U.S. government in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, as 

 
Invitation for Bid 
IFB Number 03A3974

well as any sanctions imposed under state law unless the contract has been Federalized (i.e. 
there is federal participation in any phase). By submitting a bid or proposal, Contractor represents 
that it is not a target of Economic Sanctions. Should the State determine Contractor is a target of 
Economic Sanctions or is conducting prohibited transactions with sanctioned individuals or 
entities, that shall be grounds for rejection of the Contractor’s bid/proposal any time prior to 
contract execution, or, if determined after contract execution, shall be grounds for termination by 
the State.
